# PongPongGame
## A fully functional project written in C# that is a pong game and has a score, highscore, and menu.

This project was a practice project to show if I could make a simple game without a game engine, but with the monogame framework.

#Press Enter to Start the Game
#Move the mouse to move the racket
#The Ball's speed increases everytime it hits the racket
#Every time the ball hits the racket you get 1 point
